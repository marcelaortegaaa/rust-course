The sky at dawn unfolds in layers of quiet color — pale gold, soft rose, and the faintest whisper of blue.
Clouds drift like thought, shapeless and luminous, catching the sun’s first tremors of warmth.
Birds trace invisible paths through the still air, their wings glinting briefly as if dusted with light.

By noon, the heavens widen into brilliance. The Sun reigns in the center, unblinking, sovereign.
Each star, hidden now, waits behind the curtain of day, patient as memory.
The sky breathes in waves of blue so deep it almost hums.
The wind, invisible but felt, carries scents of dust, of grass, of distance.

Evening arrives gently, as though the world exhales.
The light folds into itself, turning gold to amber, amber to violet.
The first Star appears — tentative, trembling, then certain.
Soon another star, and another star; constellations awaken like ancient songs returning to their rhythm.

Night deepens.
The Moon climbs the sky with slow precision, trailing its silver tide across roofs and rivers.
Stars scatter in impossible numbers — star, Star, star — until the dark becomes alive with fire.
There is no silence quite like this: only the low hum of the Earth turning, the whisper of leaves, the sigh of the sea.

Somewhere, a late wind stirs.
It touches the trees, brushes a sleeping window, and goes on its way.
The night holds everything — memory, dream, promise — in its cool, eternal hand.
And above it all, the sky remains: vast, watchful, unbroken.
